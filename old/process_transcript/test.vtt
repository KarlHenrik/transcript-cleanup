Hello! The project is generally focused on how different courses and tasks in physics,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
in a physics bachelor and computational physics master programme,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
leads to the development of programming skills, strategies and values.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
This part of the project. Involves? Interviewing... You about your! Experiences taking physics,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
mathematics and programming courses and writing your master's thesis.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
I'd like to audio and video record these interviews through Zoom.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
I'd also like to do a separate audio recording as a backup.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
I'd also like to collect your master's thesis and code,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
as well as reports and code from the relevant project-based courses.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
These data will be held strictly confidential.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Only I, the research team and data processors, like transcribers,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
will have access to them.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
They'll then be stored on a secure server or encrypted computer during the study.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
We'll eventually transcribe them and replace your names with pseudonyms,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
so that you will not be identifiable in any results from the study.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
At the end of the study, in 2028, the latest, the recordings will be deleted.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
It's completely voluntary to participate and you can withdraw your consent at any time.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Whether you choose to participate will have no effect on your grade for your thesis

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
or any course you take here at UAL.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Hello, my name is Carl Henrik.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm doing a PhD in physics education research here at UAL.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Today I'll ask you some questions about your experiences with computation and programming during your studies.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Some questions will be about the types of activities you have done or skills you have acquired.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Others will be about your opinions and preferences when it comes to computation and programming.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
Please tell me as much as you can about the questions I'm going to ask.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Even if you don't care about programming or didn't do much computation during your studies,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
I want to know as much as possible about what you know and what you think about it.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
We'll start by talking a little bit about your background.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
After that, we'll go in depth on how you use programming during your thesis work.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Finally, we'll talk about your experiences with computation during your bachelor's and master's courses.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Do you have any questions before we start?
